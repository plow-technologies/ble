-- This examples contains a simple Characteristic which only allows encrypted
-- authenticated reads. If the device pairing was not authenticated and
-- encrypted, the characteristic cannot be read. The default bluetooth agent
-- can handle PIN authentication. Check that the relevant device is setup to
-- use encryption and authentication:
--
--  hciconfig <dev>      -- e.g hciconfig hci0
--
-- Or change it with e.g.:
--
--  hciconfig <dev> auth
